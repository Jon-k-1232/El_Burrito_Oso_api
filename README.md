The flow of the app starts with in instruction screen, for which the user selected to go to the search screen. From the search screen a rating scale map is given to help user understand the quality of review scores. Once the user inputs and address the Map will render, with location information, along with a list of the hits and rating scores.

Should a user choose to leave a review the user will click leave review, provide the prompted information than confirm.
